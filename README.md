We have to find the Strategy of both players for below-given Strategy game in Sn. 

  Here, let us denote the game as starting on some specified node and players Aeln a and
  B alternate, with A moving first. There is one specified node that is winning for a player
  A and one for B. For concreteness, we will declare the ascending order permutation as
  winning for A and the descending order permutation as winning for player B. At each
  step, the player can choose a neighboring node to the current node, stipulating that 
  revisiting an already visited node is disallowed. Figure out the algorithmic complexity and 
  combinatorial properties of which player has a winning strategy for any given input 
  configuration (n of Sn, and the starting configuration).
  
Code for this Strategy Game in C++ is also uploaded. You can check it out.
